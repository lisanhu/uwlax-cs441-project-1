## Description:
It a simple self made shell program.

This program is capable of separating strings entered by user or reading a file and separate each job then display them.

It can also tell the difference between builtin, foreground and background commands.
At the bottom, the total numbers of all jobs and foreground and background jobs will be output.

---
## How to compile:

A Makefile is provided in this assignment.
To compile the application:

    $ make

To clean the build:

    $ make clean

---
## How to run:

To run the program from the command line simply execute the following command.
You may also pass arguments to the command, just as you do in local shell before.

    $ ./mysh

The command above indicates the interactive mode for the shell

For batch mode
    
    $ ./mysh [input file path] [...]
    
You can input several file names at the same time.

---
## Example(s):

This example runs with a simple input command `./mysh tests/file.txt` provided by the
user.
```
Job 1 : "/bin/date"
Job 2 : "/bin/pwd"
Job 3 : "/bin/ls" [tests] [..]
Job 4x: "history"
Job 5 : "/bin/pwd"
Job 6 : "ls" [..]
Job 7*: "sleep" [5]
Job 8*: "/bin/sleep" [3]
-------------------------------
Total number of jobs		       = 7
Total number of jobs in history    = 8
Total number of jobs in background = 2
-------------------------------
```
This example runs with a simple input command `./mysh` to start the shell, provided by the
user.
```
mysh$ date
Job 1 : "date"
mysh$ /bin/pwd
Job 2 : "/bin/pwd"
mysh$ ls tests ..
Job 3 : "ls" [tests] [..] mysh$
mysh$ /bin/date; pwd ; /bin/ls tests .. Job 4 : "/bin/date"
Job 5 : "pwd"
Job 6 : "/bin/ls" [tests] [..]
mysh$ sleep 5 & /bin/sleep 4 &
Job 7*: "sleep" [5]
Job 8*: "/bin/sleep" [4]
mysh$ jobs
Job 9x: "jobs"
mysh$ history
Job 10x: "history"
mysh$ exit
Job 11x: "exit" -------------------------------
Total number of jobs
Total number of jobs in history
Total number of jobs in background = 2
```

## How to test:

To use the built-in test:

    $ make check-part1
    
To use the customed test:

    $ make mycheck-mypart1

---
## Known bugs & limitations:

* Only implement one built-in function: exit
* Our shell cannot run programs right now
* Need to implement more built-in function: jobs, history
